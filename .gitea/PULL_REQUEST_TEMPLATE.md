Thank you for your contribution! ðŸŽ‰ 

Please make sure that you:

- Use `git rebase` to bring your branch up to date, do not use a merge commit
  for that
- Do not add translations by editing the language variants of strings.xml as
  that creates merge conflicts between Codeberg git repo and Weblate git repo,
  use Weblate https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/freeyourgadget/gadgetbridge/
- do not use `e.printStacktrace()`, use slf4j logger or `GB.toast` for logging
  as per https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Developer-Documentation#logging
- Please erase these hints from this PR :), thank you!
